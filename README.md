# Redo122
I am a 16 year old C# developer that creates completly pointless programs and doesn't really know what he's doing.
# Currently Projects:
<a href="https://github.com/Redo122/Big-Text-Generator">Big Text Generator</a> - Finished for now.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Redo122/ToyPackRedo">ToyPackRedo - My 1.6.4 resource pack, based on ToyPack by toydotgame.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Redo122/Word-Racers">Word Racers</a> - In a working state, waiting for bugs.
